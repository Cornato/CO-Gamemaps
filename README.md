# CO-Gamemaps
In order to be able to create a new Gamemap.dat, you have to put all the lines that you want to convert to .dat, and the program will convert them all at one time instead of the old program that was creating this thing, but line after line

Just make sure After Build the project add the Maps.txt because you have to put the lines in this file
